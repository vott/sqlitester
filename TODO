Todo:
  ✔ Clone  DVWA VM (Docker). @done(18-10-13 10:58)
  ☐ Write a short python program that will crawl the application and detect an SQL injection vulnerability in the form at: /vulnerabilities/sqli/

Constrains:
  ☐ Spend approximately 2 to 3 hours.

Requirements:
  Software:
    Python:
      ☐ Easily testable. (Linting, OOD)
      Crawler:
        ☐ Recover if the crawler process dies mid crawl (database, auto-recovery).
        ☐ Avoid crawling out of scope or narrowing the focus of the crawler. (database table)
    ☐ Design to be extended across multiple servers (controller that spawns multiple workers to go through the tree finding sqli vulnerabilities)
    ☐ Design could be extended to include multiple SQL injection payloads. (database table)
    ☐ Retrieve database username and version
  Architecture:
    ☐ Architecture diagram
    ☐ Design to be extended across multiple servers
  ☐ Redact text about Thinking when building a solution

Non explicit requirements:
  ✔ MongoDb as a Database @done(18-10-14 14:29)

Steps:
  ☐ Setup the docker image if it is needed.
  ☐ Authenticate to the app: admin/password.
  ☐ Alter the 'security' cookie to 'low' in requests - otherwise filtering will be applied.
  ☐ Use a logical check to confirm the vulnerability.
  ☐ Exploit to obtain the database username and version (it is a MySQL database) as further confirmation.
